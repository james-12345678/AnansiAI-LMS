# Subject Creation Fix

## Issue Identified

The subject creation was not being reflected in the subjects table because the `SubjectManagement.tsx` component was using **mock logic** instead of calling the real API.

## Root Cause

The `handleAdd`, `handleEdit`, and `handleDelete` functions in `SubjectManagement.tsx` were:

1. **Creating local objects** instead of calling the API
2. **Updating local state** instead of persisting to the database
3. **Not refreshing from the API** after operations

This meant subjects appeared to be created locally but were never saved to the backend.

## Fix Applied

### ✅ Updated `handleAdd` Function

**Before (Mock Logic):**

```typescript
const newSubject: Subject = {
  id: Date.now().toString(),
  name: formData.name,
  // ... mock local object
};
setSubjects([...subjects, newSubject]); // Only local state
```

**After (Real API):**

```typescript
const createData = {
  institutionId: 1,
  subjectName: formData.name,
  description: formData.description,
  isActive: true,
  curriculumId: parseInt(formData.curriculumIds[0]),
};

const createdSubject = await adminApiService.createSubject(createData);
await loadSubjects(); // Refresh from API
```

### ✅ Updated `handleEdit` Function

Now uses `adminApiService.updateSubject()` with proper API data format.

### ✅ Updated `handleDelete` Function

Now uses `adminApiService.deleteSubject()` with proper API call.

## API Integration Details

### Create Subject API Call

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/subjects/add-subject`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "institutionId": 1,
  "subjectName": "Mathematics",
  "description": "Core mathematics subject",
  "isActive": true,
  "curriculumId": 2
}
```

### Key Changes Made

1. **Real API Calls**: All CRUD operations now call the actual API endpoints
2. **Data Refresh**: After create/update/delete, the component calls `loadSubjects()` to refresh from API
3. **Proper Data Format**: Uses API-expected field names (`subjectName` instead of `name`)
4. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
5. **Curriculum Selection**: Uses the first selected curriculum ID from the form

## Expected Behavior (Once API Connection Works)

1. **Create Subject**: New subjects will be saved to database and appear in the table
2. **Edit Subject**: Changes will be persisted to database
3. **Delete Subject**: Subjects will be removed from database
4. **List Refresh**: Table will show real data from your API
5. **Curriculum Dropdowns**: Will show real curriculums you've added
6. **Form Validation**: Proper validation with API-aware duplicate checking

## Current Status

- ✅ **Subject Creation Fixed**: Now uses real API instead of mock logic
- ✅ **Subject Update Fixed**: Now uses real API
- ✅ **Subject Delete Fixed**: Now uses real API
- ✅ **Data Refresh Fixed**: Reloads from API after operations
- ✅ **Build Successful**: All changes compile without errors
- ❌ **API Connection**: Still blocked by mixed content security (HTTPS→HTTP)

## Next Steps

Once the mixed content issue is resolved (API supports HTTPS or frontend deployed on HTTP), subjects will:

1. **Be created and saved** to your database
2. **Appear in the subjects table** immediately
3. **Show in curriculum dropdowns** for milestones/goals
4. **Persist between page refreshes**
5. **Reflect real data counts** in overview cards

The subject creation functionality is now properly configured to work with your API!
