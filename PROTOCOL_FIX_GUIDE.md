# 🔧 HTTPS/HTTP Protocol Issue Fixed

## ❌ **The Problem**

Your system was trying to call **HTTPS** but your API is on **HTTP**:

- ❌ **Frontend was calling**: `https://13.60.98.134/anansiai/api`
- ✅ **Your actual API**: `http://13.60.98.134/anansiai/api`

This caused all API calls to fail because the HTTPS endpoint doesn't exist.

## ✅ **The Fix Applied**

I've updated the API configuration to **force HTTP** for your backend:

```typescript
// Before: Auto-detected protocol based on frontend
const apiProtocol = isSecure ? "https" : "http";

// After: Force HTTP for your API
const apiProtocol = "http";
```

## 🚨 **Mixed Content Warning**

Since your **frontend is HTTPS** and **API is HTTP**, browsers may block the requests due to "Mixed Content" security policy.

### **Browser Console May Show:**

```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS,
but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint 'http://...'.
This request has been blocked.
```

## 🎯 **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Test with HTTP Frontend (Recommended for Testing)**

1. Access your frontend via **HTTP** instead of HTTPS:
   - Instead of: `https://your-frontend.com`
   - Use: `http://your-frontend.com` (if available)

### **Option 2: Enable HTTPS on Your API (Production Ready)**

Configure your .NET API to support HTTPS:

```csharp
// In Program.cs
builder.Services.AddHttpsRedirection(options =>
{
    options.HttpsPort = 443;
});

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
```

### **Option 3: Allow Insecure Content (Testing Only)**

In your browser:

1. Click the **🔒 lock icon** in address bar
2. Click **"Site settings"**
3. Change **"Insecure content"** to **"Allow"**
4. Reload the page

## 🧪 **Test Now**

1. **Refresh the page** - the API should now call HTTP correctly
2. **Check browser console** for the new API configuration log
3. **Click "Test API" button** in the institutions section
4. **Look for mixed content warnings** in console

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **Success Case:**

```
🔧 API Configuration: {
  frontendProtocol: "https:",
  apiUrl: "http://13.60.98.134/anansiai/api",
  forcedHTTP: true
}
✅ API Response Data: [your institutions]
```

### ❌ **Mixed Content Blocked:**

```
⚠️ Mixed Content Warning: HTTPS frontend calling HTTP API may be blocked
🔧 Solutions: 1) Serve API over HTTPS, or 2) Use HTTP frontend
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Try refreshing now** - should work if browser allows mixed content
2. **If blocked**: Use HTTP frontend URL for testing
3. **For production**: Set up HTTPS on your .NET API server

The institutions you created should now be visible! 🎉
